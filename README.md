# Fullscreen Video Website

A simple website template with a fullscreen video background.

## How to Use

1. Replace the `video.mp4` file with your own video file.
2. Edit the content in `index.html` to customize the text.
3. Adjust the styles in `styles.css` to match your design preferences.

## Notes

- The video is set to autoplay, loop, and be muted by default.
- The website is responsive and will work on various screen sizes.
- For better mobile support, consider adding a fallback image background.
